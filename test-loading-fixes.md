## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Login Process
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to login page
3. Enter credentials and login
4. **Expected**: Should login within 10 seconds without hanging

### Test 2: Academy Page Loading
1. Login as a user
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/academy`
3. **Expected**: Page should load modules within 10 seconds
4. **Expected**: If timeout occurs, error message with retry button should appear

### Test 3: Lesson Navigation
1. Go to academy page
2. Click on a module
3. Click on a lesson
4. **Expected**: Lesson should load within 8 seconds
5. **Expected**: Video should start loading properly

### Test 4: Trainingscentrum Loading
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/trainingscentrum`
2. **Expected**: Page should load user's selected schema and nutrition plan
3. **Expected**: No infinite loading states

### Test 5: Debug Panel Monitoring
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` or add `?debug=true` to URL
2. Open Debug Panel (bottom right)
3. **Expected**: Should show current loading states
4. **Expected**: Should show cache information
5. **Expected**: Should provide controls to clear stuck states

### Test 6: Error Recovery
1. Simulate slow network (Chrome DevTools > Network > Slow 3G)
2. Navigate to academy page
3. **Expected**: Should show timeout error after 10 seconds
4. Click "Retry" button
5. **Expected**: Should attempt to reload data

### Test 7: Component Cleanup
1. Navigate between pages quickly
2. **Expected**: No memory leaks or stuck loading states
3. Check Debug Panel for active loading states

## ðŸ”§ Debug Tools Available

### Debug Panel Features
- Real-time loading state monitoring
- Cache size and issue detection
- Auth status display
- Performance metrics
- Quick actions for clearing stuck states

### Console Logging
- All auth operations are logged with timestamps
- Data fetching operations show start/completion
- Error states are clearly logged
- Cleanup operations are tracked

### Loading State Manager
- Tracks all active loading operations
- Automatically times out stuck states
- Provides global clearing mechanism
- Integrates with Debug Panel

## ðŸš¨ Known Limitations

1. **Supabase Connection**: If Supabase is down, all operations will timeout gracefully
2. **Network Issues**: Slow networks will trigger timeout mechanisms
3. **Browser Memory**: Very old browsers might have performance issues

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… No indefinite "Laden..." states
- âœ… All operations timeout within reasonable time (5-15 seconds)
- âœ… Clear error messages with retry options
- âœ… Proper cleanup on component unmount
- âœ… Debug tools available for troubleshooting
- âœ… Smooth navigation between pages
- âœ… Memory usage remains stable
